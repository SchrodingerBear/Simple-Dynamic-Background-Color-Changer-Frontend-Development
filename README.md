# Simple Dynamic HTML Background Color Changer 

This is a simple frontend project that allows users to dynamically change the background color of a web page. It features a hidden color changer button that becomes visible upon interaction. Users can select a color from a color picker interface, and the webpage's background color will change accordingly.

## Features

- Hidden Color Changer Button: The color changer button is initially hidden with an opacity set to 0, and is positioned at the center making it discreet and unobtrusive.

- Interactive: When users click the hidden button labeled "Click Me," it triggers the appearance of a color picker interface.

- Dynamic Background Color: As the user selects a color, the background color of the entire webpage dynamically changes to match the chosen color.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Provides the structure and content of the webpage.

- CSS: Defines the styles and layout of the page elements, including the hidden color changer button.

- JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the page, making the color changer button functional and enabling dynamic background color changes.
